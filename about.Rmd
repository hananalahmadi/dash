# Data Sources

Hepatitis B and C surveillance cases were obtained from the Saudi Open Data Platform. Population denominators, essential for calculating expected disease counts, were extracted from the Saudi Census Portal. All data were aggregated at the administrative region level, encompassing Saudi Arabia's 13 regions. The temporal coverage varies by disease: hepatitis C data spans from 2019 to 2022, while hepatitis B data is available for 2019 only.


# Spatial temporal disease mapping

The spatial temporal disease mapping model can be expressed as follows: 

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
y_{ij} &\sim Po(E_{ij}\theta_{ij}), \\
\log(\theta_{ij}) &= \alpha + \sum_{f = 1}^{F} \beta_f X_{i f} + (\beta + \Delta_i) \times t_j+ b_i
\end{split}
\label{diseasemappingtemporal}
\end{equation}
where $y_{ij}$ is the number of the disease cases observed at region $i$ and year $j$, $E_{ij}$ is the expected count at region $i$ and year $j$, $\theta_{ij}$ is the relative risk of region $i$ and year $j$, \(\alpha\) represents the overall risk level, $\beta_f$ is the $f$-th fixed effect with covariate $\mathbf{X}_f$, $\beta$ represent the fixed effect in time that captures the global linear trend over time, $\Delta_i$ follow independent and identically normal distribution and it represent the interaction between space and time, capturing how the area-specific trend deviates from the global trend $\beta$, $b_i$ represents the spatial random effect that follow BYM.

# Joint disease mapping

The joint disease mapping model based on an shared component model (SCM) for two diseases can be expressed as follows for region $i$, $i = 1,....,n$:
\begin{eqnarray}
y_{i 1}|\theta_{i1} &\sim& \text{Poisson}\left(E_{i 1} \theta_{i 1}\right) \nonumber \\
y_{i 2}|\theta_{i2} &\sim& \text{Poisson}\left(E_{i 2} \theta_{i 2}\right) \nonumber \\
\log (\theta_{i 1}) &=& \alpha_{1} + \sum_{f = 1}^{F_1} \beta_f X_{i f} + b_{i 1} + S_{i} \nonumber \\
\log (\theta_{i 2}) &=& \alpha_{2} + \sum_{f = 1}^{F_2} \gamma_f Z_{i f} + b_{i 2} + a S_{i} 
\label{eq:jointmeanmodel}
\end{eqnarray}
where $y_{ij}$ represents the number of cases of disease $j$ in region $i$, $\theta_{ij}$ is the relative risk of disease $j$ in region $i$, and $E_{ij}$ is the expected number of cases for disease $j$ in region $i$. Additionally, $\alpha_j$ is a disease-specific intercept for disease $j$, $\beta_f$ is the $f$-th fixed effect for disease 1 with covariate $\mathbf{X}_f$, and $\gamma_f$ is the $f$-th fixed effect for disease 2 with covariate $\mathbf{Z}_f$. 
The term $b_{ij}$ represents a disease-specific spatial random effect (modeled using the Besag-York-MolliÃ© (BYM) model), while $S_i$ is the shared spatial random effect with a proper Besag prior, parameterized by $\tau$ and $d$.
    \begin{equation}
        S_{i}|\mathbf{S}_{-i} \sim N\left(\bar{S}_{\delta_i}, \frac{\tau^{-1}}{(n_{\delta_i}+d)}\right), \forall i =1,\ldots, n,
        \label{eq:besagproper}
    \end{equation}
where  $d> 0$ for an non-intrinsic model, $\delta_i$ represent the index set of neighbors for area $i$, and $n_{\delta_i}$ denote the number of neighbors for area $i$. The term $\bar{S}_{\delta_i}$ is defined as the average of the neighboring values, given by 
$\bar{S}_{\delta_i} = \frac{1}{n_{\delta_i}} \sum_{j \in \delta_i} S_j,$
where $S_j$ represents the values for neighboring areas. Additionally, $\tau$ refers to the precision parameter.
Here, $a$ and the shared component $\mathbf{S}$ are used to evaluate the spatial dependence between the two diseases, while the random effect $\mathbf{b}_j$ captures the spatial effect within each disease. The prior for $a$ is assumed to be Gaussian, with mean 0 and variance 1.
