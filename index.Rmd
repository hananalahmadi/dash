Disease risk mapping is a valuable tool for understanding the spatial variation of diseases by incorporating geographical information. In cases where data are available across multiple time periods, denoted as \( j \), with \( j = 1, \dots, J \), a spatio-temporal disease mapping model is needed to account for both spatial and temporal variability in disease risk. When two or more diseases share common risk factors, treating
them as independent may lead to inaccurate conclusions. In such cases, modeling the
diseases separately can be misleading, as it fails to account for the shared underlying risk
factors. A joint disease mapping approach would be more appropriate to capture the dependency
between diseases and provide a more accurate estimation of the relative risks. In this dashboard we present a spatio-temporal disease mapping for hepatitis C and joint disease mapping for hepatitis C and hepatitis B.
